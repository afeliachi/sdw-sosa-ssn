<h3>SSN profiles</h3>
<p>
    The SSN Ontology provides a set of general terms for describing Actuations, Observations, and Samplings.
    However, the supporting classes
    (i.e., <a href="#SOSAProcedure">`Procedure`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSAActuatingProcedure">`ActuatingProcedure`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSAObservingProcedure">`ObservingProcedure`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSASamplingProcedure">`SamplingProcedure`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSASystem">`System`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSAActuator">`Actuator`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSASensor">`Sensor`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSASampler">`Sampler`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSAFeatureOfInterest">`FeatureOfInterest`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSASample">`Sample`</a>,
    <a href="#SOSAProperty">`Property`</a>,
    etc.) have no properties specified, except for the relationships between individuals from the classes.
    Furthermore, there are a large number of these relationship predicates, which can lead to a rather tangled
    dataset, in practice.
    Thus, any application that uses SSN must select an <em>implementation pattern</em> to constrain the variability.
    And in order to support interoperability with other applications, the implementation pattern should be
    formalized and shared.

<p>
    It is beyond the scope of this document to provide implementation profiles.
    However, a number of frequent requirements are discussed and illustrated in this section, including quantity
    values with a unit of measure, locations, and forecasts.

<p class="note">OGC is planning to develop a register of SSN implementation profiles to support the development of
    interoparable communities using SSN.</p>
