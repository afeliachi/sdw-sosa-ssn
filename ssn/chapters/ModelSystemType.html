<h3>Systems Types and Individuals</h3>
<p>
    <a>sosa:System</a> is the class of systems,
    i.e., devices or entities that implements procedures to make actuations, observations, or samplings.
    Members of the class are <em>individual</em> systems i.e., system-instances.
    In the physical world these will typically carry a serial-number (devices) or proper-name (people).
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, most individual systems share a primary description with other individuals of the same system
    type or model number.
    The characteristics and capabilities of the <em>system type</em> will often provide the key information
    about a system involved in an execution.
    Traditionally this information would appear in a specification or <em>data-sheet</em> for a device type.
</p>
<p>
    The SSN Ontology may be used to describe system types as OWL Classes, so that system instances can be typed
    through them.
    The recommended pattern is for
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        a generic system or system type is represented as an OWL Class, specifically as a sub-class of
        <a>sosa:System</a> (specifically: one of its sub-classes
        <a>sosa:Actuator</a>,
        <a>sosa:Sensor</a>,
        <a>sosa:Sampler</a>), while
    </li>
    <li>
        an individual system or system instance is represented as an OWL Individual, specifically as an
        instance of the class describing the system type.</li>
</ul>

    The following code snippet provides an outline of the details:
</p>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/Thermometer.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
<p class="note">
    This approach is a clarification and adjustment relative to earlier editions of this Ontology, which suggested that
    instances of <a>sosa:System</a> could represent either generic systems or instances
    specific to a single execution.
</p>

<p>
    More complex systems can be described using class definitions with OWL Restrictions to fix specific
    properties of class members.
    For example, the following code illustrates how a sensor package, such as an
    <a href="https://inkbird.com/products/ibs-th2-plus">Inkbird model IBS-TH2-PLUS</a>, may be described.
</p>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/IBS-TH2-PLUS.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
<ul>
    <li>
        `sensor:IBS-TH2-Plus` describes the <em>IBS-TH2-PLUS system type</em>.
        Every IBS-TH2-PLUS package records at a frequency in the range 5.556e-4 &mdash; 0.1 Hertz.
        Every IBS-TH2-PLUS has two subsystems, one temperature sensor, and one relative-humidity sensor.
    </li>
    <li>
        `sensor:IBS-TH2-Plus-H` describes the <em>humidity sensor type</em> in the IBS-TH2-PLUS
        package.
        Every humidity sensor has a range 0&mdash;99 % RH with an accuracy of 4.5 %.
    </li>
    <li>
        `sensor:IBS-TH2-Plus-T` describes the <em>temperature sensor type</em> in the
        IBS-TH2-PLUS package.
        Every temperature sensor has a range -40&mdash;60 &deg;C with an accuracy of 4.5 %.
    </li>
</ul>
