<p>Data conforms to SSN if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Access to data is organized around <a href="#SOSAActuation">Actuations</a>,
    <a href="#SOSAObservation">Observations</a>, and <a href="#SOSASampling">Samplings</a>,
    which represent executions of Actuating, Observing and Sampling <a href="#SOSAProcedure">Procedures</a>,
    implemented by <a href="#SOSAActuator">Actuators</a>, <a href="#SOSASensor">Sensors</a> and
    <a href="#SOSASampler">Samplers</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The contents of all data fields are expressed using the appropriate RDF classes and properties from SSN.
    Where no such class or property exists, sub-classes or sub-properties specializing SSN in a domain-specific web
    ontology are employed.
  </li>
  <li>
    All classes and properties from SSN are used in a way consistent with the semantics declared in this specification,
    as so any SSN sub-classes or sub-properties specialised in domain-specific ontologies used to express the concerned
    data.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  SSN-compliant knowledge graphs MAY include additional non-SSN class instances, object and data properties, and
  additional RDF data.
