<h3>Location and Geometry</h3>

<h4>Location</h4>
<p>
    Many of the key classes provided by SOSA and SSN represent entities that can be located in space such as
    sensors, features of interest, actuators, samples, and so forth, or activities that can be located via their
    participating entities, e.g., platforms.
    These entities will usually be described using models and ontologies defined for application domains,
    including technical disciplines, social and business contexts.
    In these contexts there are a number of implementations that support the expression of spatial properties,
    including location.
    These are discussed further in the Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices note [[SDW-BP]].
</p>
<p>
    In particular, GeoSPARQL [[GeoSPARQL]] provides a flexible and relatively complete platform for geospatial
    objects, that fosters interoperability between geo-datasets.
    The property `geo:hasGeometry` MAY be used to attach a geometry or location to any entity.
    Note that `geo:hasGeometry` has a global domain constraint which entails that any resource carrying this
    property SHALL be inferred to be a `geo:Feature`
    (<a href="https://docs.ogc.org/is/22-047r1/22-047r1.html#_01414b7a-8464-4a9b-897d-46c471274ea6">GeoSPARQL 1.1,
        clause 8.4.1</a>).
    In case of classes, e.g., specific types of features of interest such as rivers, these MAY be explicitly defined as
    subclasses of `geo:Feature`.
</p>

<h5>Systems, Platforms, Deployments</h5>

<p>
    A number of patterns may be used to characterize the location of a <a href="#SOSASystem">System</a>, depending on
    how much detail about <a href="#SOSAPlatform">Platforms</a> and <a href="#SOSADeployment">Deployments</a> is useful.
</p>

<p>
    For example, a System, such as a <a href="#SOSASensor">Sensor</a>, might be permanently in one specific location,
    described as follows:
</p>
<figure id="Fig-LocatedSensor">
    <embed alt="sensor location &mdash; direct" src="./images/LocatedSensor.svg" style="width:60%" />
    <figcaption>System location &mdash; direct description <br>
        <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/LocatedSensor.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<p>
    Alternatively, the location may be associated with a Platform, which then might also host other Systems:
</p>
<figure id="Fig-LocatedPlatform">
    <embed alt="sensor location &mdash; on a platform" src="./images/LocatedPlatform.svg" style="width:75%" />
    <figcaption>System location &mdash; on Platform
        <br>
        <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/LocatedPlatform.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<p>
    If this Sensor location is not permanent, then it may be characterized as a Deployment:
</p>
<figure id="Fig-LocatedDeployment">
    <embed alt="sensor location &mdash; in a deployment" src="./images/LocatedDeployment.svg" style="width:75%" />
    <figcaption>System location &mdash; in a Deployment <br>
        <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/LocatedDeployment.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>


<h5>Samples, Features</h5>

<p>Similarly, Location can be associated directly or indirectly with a <a href="#SOSASample">Sample</a>. </p>

<p>
    Observations of the atmosphere are necessarily made at a specific location.
    The location of an air Sample might be recorded directly using the following pattern:
</p>
<figure id="Fig-LocatedSample">
    <embed alt="Location of a Sample" src="./images/LocatedSample.svg" style="width:75%" />
    <figcaption>Sample location &mdash; direct descriptions <br>
        <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/LocatedSample.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<p>
    The location could also be provided as a parameter to the act of Sampling that generated the Sample:
</p>
<figure id="Fig-LocatedSampling">
    <embed alt="Location of a Sampling" src="./images/LocatedSampling.svg" style="width:75%" />
    <figcaption>Sample location &mdash; indirect descriptions <br>
        <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/LocatedSampling.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<h4>Relative location patterns</h4>
<p>
    In general, the locations of the <a href="#SOSASystem">System</a> and
    <a href="#SOSAFeatureOfInterest">FeatureOfInterest</a> for an <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a> are different.
    For example, the <em>relative</em> locations of the <a href="#SOSASensor">Sensor</a>
    (or its <a href="#SOSAPlatform">Platform</a> or <a href="#SOSADeployment">Deployment</a>) and the feature of
    interest (or <a href="#SOSASample">Sample</a>), along with the <a href="#SOSAphenomenonTime">phenomenon-</a> and
    <a href="#SOSAresultTime">result-time</a>, fall into distinct
    patterns for different <a href="#SOSAObservation">Observation</a> modes as follows:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>in situ monitoring</dt>
    <dd>location of sensor and feature of interest are the same</dd>
    <dt>remote sensing</dt>
    <dd>location of sensor is remote from the feature of interest</dd>
    <dt>ex situ observation (e.g., lab measurements)</dt>
    <dd>location of sensor and location of the ultimate feature of interest are different; result-time later than
        phenomenon-time</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Note that in ex situ measurements, there will usually be a <a href="#SOSASample">Sample</a> and thus an act of
    <a href="#SOSASampling">Sampling</a> involved, whose properties determine the location and phenomenon-time.
</p>

<h4>Geometry results</h4>
<p>
    Geometry may appear in other contexts.
    For example, a determination of location using a GPS receiver can be described as an
    <a href="#SOSAObservation">Observation</a> whose <a href="#SOSAhasResult">hasResult</a> value is a geometry.
    The following example illustrates this pattern, with the result being a GeoSPARQL `Geometry` object:
</p>
<figure id="Fig-GeometryResult">
    <embed alt="Geometry as the result of an observation" src="./images/GeometryResult.svg" style="width:75%" />
    <figcaption>Geometry as the result of an observation <br>
        <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/GeometryResult.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
<p>
    The WKT representation of the result could be encoded directly as a 'simple' (literal) result:
</p>
<pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/GeometryResultSimple.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>
