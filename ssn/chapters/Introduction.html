<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>
  Sensors are a major source of data available on the Web today.
  However, searching, reusing, integrating, and interpreting sensor data requires more than just the result of an act of
  sensing.
  For proper interpretation of these values, knowledge of the feature of interest, such as a river, the observed
  property, such as flow velocity, the sampling strategy, such as the specific locations and times at which the velocity
  was measured, and a variety of other information are required.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, the Web of Things makes actuators and the data they produce first-class citizens of the Web.
  Parallel to sensors and observations, searching, reusing, integrating, and interpreting actuator data requires more
  than just the actuation input and result values.
  Knowledge of the feature of interest, such as a smart thermostat, the actuated property, such as temperature
  setpoint, and a variety of other information are required.
</p>

<p>
  OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards [[SWE]], [[SensorML]], [[OandM]], [[OMS]], [[STA]] provide
  conceptual models and some encodings for the annotation of sensors and their observations.
  [[OMS]] provides a comprehensive description of the characteristics of observations and samples.
  Integration and alignment of these with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data embeds this in a global and
  densely interconnected graph of data.
</p>

<p>
  The ETSI Smart Applications REFerence ontology ([[SAREF]]) forms a shared model of consensus intended to enable
  semantic interoperability and data portability between solutions from different providers and among various activity
  sectors in the Internet of Things (IoT), such as smart energy systems, smart cities, smart homes, etc.
  [[SAREF]] provides a generic description of devices, such as sensors and actuators, the functions and individual
  commands they expose to some network, and the physical systems upon which these devices act.
</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>
  This recommendation defines the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (<b>SSN</b>).
  SSN provides flexible but coherent perspectives for representing the entities, relations, and activities involved in
  actuation, observation, and sampling, including the procedures executed, and the systems that implement the
  procedures.
  Supporting concepts include platforms, deployments, observed or actuated properties, features of interest, and
  resulting samples, along with collections (sets) of executions and results that are typically involved in analysis and
  implementation.
</p>

<p>
  A lightweight core module, known as <b>SOSA</b> (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) aims to broaden the
  audience and application areas that do not need the full capabilities of Semantic Web ontologies.
  SOSA acts as minimal interoperability fall-back level, i.e., it defines terms (classes and properties) with which
  data can be safely exchanged across all uses of SSN, its modules, and SOSA.
  Basic subclass and subproperty relationships are included.
</p>

<p>
  The full SSN Ontology has additional axiomatizations that may be useful in richer semantic web applications.
</p>

<h3>2023 Edition</h3>

<p>
  The previous edition of the SSN Ontology [[vocab-ssn-20171019]] harmonised prior work from OGC ([[OandM]]) and W3C
  ([[SSNX]]).
  A new edition of the OGC/ISO standard [[iso-19156-2023]],[[[OMS]]] has updated [[OandM]] with a number of additional
  features arising from more than 10 years implementation experience.
</p>
<p>
  <b>This new edition of the SSN Ontology provides a canonical RDF implementation of OMS:
    the <a href="#OMS">OMS Extension Module</a>.</b>
</p>

<p>
  In addition, [[SAREF]] and SSN have common contributors who work on the convergence of these reference ontologies.
</p>
<p>
  <b>This new edition of the SSN Ontology provides an alignment to SAREF: the
    <a href="#SAREF-alignment">SSN-SAREF Alignment Module</a>.</b>
</p>

<p>
  Finally, direct experience with SSN has uncovered a variety of minor issues and possible improvements that have been
  addressed or accommodated.
  For example, with the increasing diversity of data and data providers, definitions for sensors and actuators have been
  broadened to include agents (including humans) and software (simulation).
</p>

<p>
  This edition of the SSN Ontology is designated <b>2023 Edition</b> corresponding to the year when revision commenced.
  It aligns with designation of the ISO standard that triggered the revision work &mdash; ISO 19156:2023 ([[OMS]]).
</p>

<p class="note">
  A number of new terms have been added to the SSN Ontology in the 2023 Edition.
  Those that have received little or no implementation testing are marked "non-normative" with a Warning note.
  These terms will be updated to normative status if implementation evidence is received during the transition process.
</p>
<p>
  A <a href="#changes">change log</a> is provided in an Annex of this document.
  This describes the changes since the 2017 edition [[vocab-ssn-20171019]].
  Backward compatibility is maintained since descriptions of Actuations, Observations, Samplings, and Samples using the
  SSN Ontology from the 2017 edition are compatible with the SSN Ontology provided by this 2023 Edition.
</p>
<p class="note">
  A brief account of the <a href="#Origins">Origins of SSN and SOSA</a> through various OGC and W3C initiatives is provided
  in an Appendix to this document.
