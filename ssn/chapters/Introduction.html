<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Sensors are a major source of data available on the Web today. However, searching, reusing, integrating, and
  interpreting sensor data requires more than just the sensing result.
  For the proper interpretation of these values, knowledge of the feature of interest, such as a river, the observed property, such as flow velocity, the sampling strategy, such as the specific locations and times at which the velocity was measured, and a variety of other information are required.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the rise of the Web of Things makes actuators and the data they produce first-class citizens of the Web. 
  Parallel to sensors and observations, searching, reusing, integrating, and interpreting actuator data requires more 
  than just the actuation input and result values.
  Knowledge of the feature of interest, such as a smart thermostat, the actuated property, such as temperature 
  setpoint, and a variety of other information are required.
</p>
<p>
  OGC's Sensor Web Enablement standards [[SWE]], [[SensorML]], [[OandM]], [[OMS]], [[STA]] provide
  conceptual models, as well as some encodings for the annotation of sensors and their observations.
  [[OMS]] provides a comprehensive description of the characteristics of observations and samples.
  Integration and alignment of these with W3C Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data embeds this in a global and
  densely interconnected graph of data.

<p>
  The ETSI Smart Applications REFerence ontology ([[SAREF]]) forms a shared model of consensus intended to enable 
  semantic interoperability and data portability between solutions from different providers and among various activity 
  sectors in the Internet of Things (IoT), such as smart energy systems, smart cities, smart homes, etc. 
  [[SAREF]] provides a generic description of devices, such as sensors and actuators, the functions and individual commands they expose to some network, and the physical systems on which these devices act upon.
</p>
<p>
  This specification defines the Semantic Sensor Network (<b>SSN</b>) ontology.
  It sets out to provide flexible but coherent perspectives for representing the entities, relations, and activities
  involved in sensing, sampling, and actuation.
  A lightweight core for SSN, known as <b>SOSA</b> (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator) aims at broadening the
  target audience and application areas that do not need the full capabilities of Semantic Web ontologies.
  SOSA acts as minimal interoperability fall-back level, i.e., it defines terms (classes and properties) with which
  data can be safely exchanged across all uses of SSN, its modules, and SOSA.
</p>
<p>
  The previous edition of the SSN Ontology [[vocab-ssn-20171019]] harmonised earlier work from OGC ([[OandM]]) and W3C
  ([[SSNX]]).
  A new edition of the OGC/ISO standard [[[OMS]]] has updated [[[OandM]]] with a number of additional features arising
  from more than 10 years implementation experience.
  <b>This new edition of the SSN Ontology provides a canonical RDF implementation of OMS (the <a href="#OMS">OMS
      Extension Module</a>).</b>
  In addition, [[SAREF]] and SSN have common contributors who work on the convergence of these reference ontologies. 
  <b>This new edition of the SSN Ontology provides an alignement to [[SAREF]] (the <a href="#SAREF-alignment">SSN-SAREF Alignment Module</a>).</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, direct experience with SSN has uncovered a variety of minor issues and possible improvements that have been addressed or accommodated. For example, with the increasing diversity of data and data providers, definitions for sensors and actuators have been broadened to include agents (including humans), or software (simulation).

  A <a href="#changes">change log</a> is provided in an Annex of this document.
  This change log describes the changes since the 2017 edition [[vocab-ssn-20171019]].

  An <a href="#Origins">Annex to this document</a> provides a brief account of the origins of the SSN ontology through
  various OGC and W3C initiatives.
