<h3>Domain types and FeatureOfInterest</h3>

<p>
    Actuations, Observations, Samplings, and Deployments can be made on any entity in any context.
    For many applications a domain-model has been previously defined.
    This will include names and definitions for classes of entities in the domain.
    For example: applications in hydrology will refer to types such as water-course, stream, river, reach,
    storage, aquifer, lake, reservoir, spring, water-table, etc.
</p>
<p>
    A property of an instance of any domain type may be observed using a sensor, or changed using an actuator,
    or the entity may be sampled following a sampling procedure.
    When this occurs, the domain entity is the <em>feature of interest</em> of the Execution.
</p>
<p>
    Does this therefore require that classes in the domain model are defined as sub-classes of
    <a>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</a>?
    No, absolutely not.
    RDF and OWL entailments do not work that way.
</p>
<p>
    The way the SSN Ontology addresses this is described in the following sub-sections.
    There are different implications depending on whether you are using the simple
    <a href="#sosa-module">SOSA</a> module, or the more expressive <a href="#ssn-module">SSN</a> module.
</p>

<h4>FeatureOfInterest in SOSA</h4>
<p>
    In SOSA the domain and range indications use the Schema.org [[schema-org]] predicates
    `schema:domainIncludes` and
    `schema:rangeIncludes`.
    For <a href="#SOSAFeatureOfInterest">feature of interest</a>, SOSA has:
</p>
<pre class="turtle">
sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest
  schema:domainIncludes sosa:Execution ;
  schema:domainIncludes sosa:Deployment ;
  schema:rangeIncludes sosa:FeatureOfInterest ;
.
</pre>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
    <li>these have no formal entailments, they are just hints</li>
    <li>'Includes' means these types are non-exclusive, so any other type is acceptable, including types from
        application-domains</li>
</ol>
<p>
    So the 'domain and range' indications in SOSA are functionally harmless.
    The fact that
<code class="turtle">sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest schema:rangeIncludes sosa:FeatureOfInterest .</code>
merely says that things of type
<a>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</a> might be found as the object of
hasFeatureOfInterest statements.
No more, no less.
</p>

<h4>FeatureOfInterest in SSN</h4>
<p>
    In SSN there are local (guarded) constraints, which can fix the range of a property
    when it appears in the context of a member of a specific class.
    Related to the <a href="#SOSAFeatureOfInterest">feature of interest</a>, SSN has:
</p>
<pre class="turtle">
sosa:Execution
  rdfs:subClassOf [
    a owl:Restriction ;
    owl:onProperty sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest ;
    owl:allValuesFrom sosa:FeatureOfInterest ] ;
.
sosa:Deployment
  rdfs:subClassOf [
    a owl:Restriction ;
    owl:onProperty sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest ;
    owl:allValuesFrom sosa:FeatureOfInterest ] ;
.
</pre>
<p>This says that, in the context of an individual <a>sosa:Execution</a>
    or <a>sosa:Deployment</a>,
    the object of <a>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</a> is always an individual
    <a>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</a>.
</p>
<p>
    However, this does not mean that (i) the object of the statement must be declared to have
    `rdf:type sosa:FeatureOfInterest` in advance, or (ii) this is its only type.
    Rather, it means that
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        when an individual appears as the object of a statement
    </li>
    <li>
        whose subject is a <a>sosa:Execution</a> or <a>sosa:Deployment</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        and whose predicate is <a>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    then it is automatically inferred to be of type <a>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</a>
    <em>in addition to</em> any other information that was already available about it, including any pre-existing type.
</p>
<p><b>This does not require you to derive domain types as sub-classes of
        <a>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</a></b>.
    It merely says that when a domain individual participates in an Execution (e.g., an Observation)
    it becomes a member of the class <a>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</a>
    <b>in addition to</b> any pre-existing domain class.
    In the context of SSN axiomatization, membership in the class
    <a>sosa:FeatureOfInterest</a>
    does not need to be asserted explicitly, and does not need to be assigned prior to the involvement of an entity in a
    <a>sosa:Execution</a> (or one of its sub-classes) or <a>sosa:Deployment</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the following scenario (<a href="#Fig-domain-feature"></a>, <a href="#Fig-domain-feature-observed"></a>).
    There is an entity typed with a class from a domain model:
</p>
<figure id="Fig-domain-feature">
    <embed alt="a domain feature" src="./images/domain-feature.svg" style="width:30%" />
    <figcaption>
        A feature classified using a domain ontology.
        <br>
        <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
<pre class="turtle">
ex:YarraAboveDightsFalls rdf:type hydro:RiverReach .
</pre>
<p>
    An observation is made concerning a property of this entity:
</p>
<figure id="Fig-domain-feature-observed">
    <embed alt="a domain feature" src="./images/domain-feature-observed.svg" style="width:90%" />
    <figcaption>
        An observation on a feature previously classified using a domain ontology.
        <br>
        <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<pre class="turtle">
ex:o345 rdf:type sosa:Observation ;
    sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest ex:YarraAboveDightsFalls ;
    sosa:observedProperty hydro:elevation ;
    sosa:hasSimpleResult "30 m"^^cdt:ucum ;
    sosa:phenomenonTime [ a time:Instant ; time:inXSDDateTime "2024-07-15T13:30:00+10:00" ; ] ;
.
</pre>
<p>
    The SSN constraint shown above entails:
    `ex:YarraAboveDightsFalls rdf:type sosa:FeatureOfInterest . `
    <em>in addition to</em> the type `hydro:RiverReach` already asserted.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of set theory, the class `hydro:RiverReach` has a non-empty intersection with the class
    `sosa:FeatureOfInterest` when a member of `hydro:RiverReach` participates in an
    <a>sosa:Observation</a> (or any other subclass of
    <a>sosa:Execution</a>).
    Domain types are not features-of-interest unless they are involved in Executions or Deployments.
    The additional typing happens to individual members of the class 'automatically', by entailment, but not to the
    domain class as a whole.
