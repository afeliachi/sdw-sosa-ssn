<h3>System Capabilities Module</h3>

<p>
    The System Capabilities Module imports SOSA and adds classes and properties required for the description of the
    operating conditions and capabilities of systems, in particular Sensors and Actuators.
</p>
            <p>The complexity of the SSN/SOSA ontologies is directly due to the complexity of the use-cases that they are
                meant to support. Previous standards and data formats have been limited by the constraints of their
                underlying technologies often resulting in solutions that were simple to implement but that could only
                handle real-life exceptions through the use of workarounds. The use of &quot;fill
                values&quot; or &quot;magic numbers&quot; were a simple and common solution to data quality requirements or to indicate equipment
                failure. Unfortunately, these could later be inadvertently analyzed as actual instrument readings.</p>
            <p>The richness of RDF/S and ontological approaches offer opportunities for the rich and deep recording of system
                information and results. This perversely creates a new problem in that the ability to handle complexity can 
                make implementation difficult and costly for implementers that are simply
                trying determine whether their ice cream is about to melt. The very richness of the semantic web
                ecosystem also makes it tempting to over-specify data structures to an extents that it becomes inflexible.</p>

            <p>The authors often wrestled with these issues when designing this standard and attempting to support the complexity
                of real-life deployments: data quality constraints must ensure that the data is sensical while making allowanced
                for the storage of out-of-bounds values that may indicate a problem with a deployed sensor.</p>

<p class="note">
    System Capabilities was a module in the 'Horizontal Segmentation' section of the previous edition of the SSN
    Ontology [[vocab-ssn-20171019]].
    This module has been heavily simplified and moved to Appendix in this edition.
</p>

<section class="informative" id="SysCap-overview">
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <div>
     <p>The System Capabilities Module comprises of has two primary concepts: the system's capability to sense and the conditions
     under which it can do so.  Both concepts are closely related and are often described as one and the same in industrial
     literature.  The System Capabilities describes the properties of the measurement being performed by the system while the
     Operating Conditions describe the potentials environments in which the system is deployed.  This separation is needed in order
     to account for the variability in the performance of the system under different environmental or operating parameters.
     Furthermore:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Some system depend on unreported environmental measurements in order to produce results (e.g., temperature is a component of
      the relative humidity calculation)
      <li>Some systems have requirements for proper operation for properties that they are unable to sense themselves
        (e.g., minimum power supply voltage)
      <li>The performance of some systems may vary according to environmental conditions (e.g., the frequency counter accuracy being
        affected by environmental temperature)
     </ul>  
        
    <p>This information allows designers to communicate complex operating behavior to the consumer of the system results and to
    simplify procurement and system deployment decision by enabling searches for systems capable of fulfilling a specific
    requirement.</p>
    <p>The implementation of capabilities and conditions is done through ObservationCollections that aggregate observations on
    features and properties without a reporting sensor. Their reuse of the observation structure ensures consistency in reporting
    values across the ontology and it may be the case that the same observation can be used for reporting both the capability and
    the operating condition. This is application dependent and nuances may sometimes prevent reuse: a thermometer's capability is
    based on its ability to measure a medium while its survival condition is based on its own physical temperature.</p>

        </figure>


    <p>System operating conditions are further qualified through a SystemConditionKind class that gives guidance as to expected desirability
    of the conditions. Three sub-classes are further provided as a basic classification: NormalOperatingConditions, SuboptimalOperatingConditions
    and SurvivableConditions. Implementers may wish to extend these classes to account for other niche conditions.
    Operating conditions are especially useful to implement performance bands through the use of specific system capabilities for
    different measurement ranges. An example are environmental sensors that present different measurement accuracies in certain
    concentration ranges or that offer detection-only capabilities at very low concentrations.</p>

    <p>Operating conditions determine which system capabilities will be in use based on the properties of the operating
    environment. It is possible with additional ontological statements to create conditions that are &quot;latching&quot;, as in the case of
    damaged sensors with permanently degraded operating characteristics. It is possible through additional observations to include
    sensor operating conditions using external inputs to implement operating modes. However the specifications does not provide guidance
    on an interoperable way to achieve this.</p>

    <p class="note">
    System Capabilities are properties that are relevant while the system is in operation. Operating Conditions may be relevant irrespective of
    the operating state; a sensor that exceeds its SurvivalCondition will be rendered inoperable irrespective of whether it was powered on or off at the
    time, as in the case of a deep water sensor reaching its crush-depth.

    <h4>Guidance on System Capability properties and ranges</h4>
    <div>
    <p>The System Capabilities module has been downsized in this edition and its vocabulary extensively reworked with a number of
    classes deprecated in favor of external vocabularies and property repositories. The module further suffered from under specification
    and lacked documentation over its intended use.</p>

    <p>The usage of Observations has been expanded capabilities and conditions through the enumeration of values and constraints on
    valued on properties and features without assigning a reporting sensor or timestamp. This allows to reuse the structure to
    report on sensor behavior. The use of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/">Data Quality Vocabulary</a>, the <a
    href="https://i-adopt.github.io/ontology/">I-ADOPT Framework ontology</a> and the <a
    href="http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/page/om-2">Ontology of Units of Measure</a> to name a few. The examples
    provided here are non-normative but lend themselves to most vocabularies.</p>


    <p>This edition has also removed the notion of &quot;Ranges&quot; within its vocabulary due to the difficulty in using
    numerical ranges as part of the specification. The use of xsd:minInclusive / xsd:maxInclusive was not ontologically possible
    due to OWL2 profile limitations and schema:minValue / schema:maxValue created additional problems relating to the property of
    the feature.</P>
    
    <p>A possible solution is the use of constrains to record sensor reading limitations using other ontologies such as I-ADOPT:</p>
     
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Example</th>
                        <td>
                            <pre>
ex:SensorCapabilityObservation a sosa:Observation ;

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>    

    <p>The advantage of this approach is that multiple statistical statements can be made about the property beyond that of simple
    maximum / minimum values, such as nominal or peak values. The Observation structure can similarly be used to report on the
    quality of individual results. In some applications, the properties of individual measurements vary within the operating
    conditions of the sensor. The values of these properties can then be reported alongside the individual result entries.</p>

            </table>    

    <p>The System Capabilities Module also introduced a Battery class to represent power supply
    requirements for mobile sensors while retaining the BatteryLifetime class. This allows to record expected battery utilization
    either on a nominal basis or within different operating conditions.</p>

                will no longer be serviceable.
