<h3>System Capabilities Module</h3>

<p>
    The System Capabilities Module imports SOSA and adds classes and properties required for the description of the
    operating conditions and capabilities of systems, in particular Sensors and Actuators.
</p>
<p>The complexity of the SSN/SOSA ontologies is directly due to the complexity of the use-cases that they are
    meant to support. Previous standards and data formats have been limited by the constraints of their
    underlying technologies often resulting in solutions that were simple to implement but that could only
    handle real-life exceptions through the use of workarounds. The use of &quot;fill
    values&quot; or &quot;magic numbers&quot; were a simple and common solution to data quality requirements or to indicate equipment
    failure. Unfortunately, these could later be inadvertently analyzed as actual instrument readings.</p>
<p>The richness of RDF/S and ontological approaches offer opportunities for the rich and deep recording of system
    information and results. This perversely creates a new problem in that the ability to handle complexity can
    make implementation difficult and costly for implementers that are simply
    trying determine whether their ice cream is about to melt. The very richness of the semantic web
    ecosystem also makes it tempting to over-specify data structures to an extents that it becomes inflexible.</p>

<p>The authors often wrestled with these issues when designing this standard and attempting to support the complexity
    of real-life deployments: data quality constraints must ensure that the data is sensical while making allowanced
    for the storage of out-of-bounds values that may indicate a problem with a deployed sensor.</p>

<p>The System Capabilities module has been downsized in this edition and its vocabulary extensively reworked with a number of
    classes deleted in favor of external vocabularies and property repositories. The module further suffered from under specification
    and lacked documentation over its intended use.
</p>

<p>The usage of <a href="#SOSAObservation">observations</a> and <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">observation collections</a> has been expanded
    to capabilities and conditions through the enumeration of values and constraints on those values without assigning a reporting sensor or timestamp.
    This allows to reuse the same structure to report on sensor behavior.
</p>

<p>This edition has also removed the notion of &quot;Ranges&quot; within its vocabulary due to the absence of an appropriate datatype or vocabulary to
    describe numerical ranges. xsd:minInclusive/xsd:maxInclusive are part of OWL reserved vocabulary, and schema:minValue/schema:maxValue created additional
    problems relating to the property of the feature. Instead, this edition recommends the specification of individual, simple properties such as
    <em>MinMeasurableTemperature</em> and <em>MaxMeasurableTemperature</em>. Apart from <a href="#SOSAhasValidityContext">hasValidityContext</a>, this edition does not
    provide means to relate properties or describe them further. External ontologies are expected to be complementary to this module, such as the
    <a href="https://i-adopt.github.io/ontology/">I-ADOPT Framework ontology</a>, and the
    <a href="http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/page/om-2">Ontology of Units of Measure</a>.

<section class="informative" id="SysCap-overview">
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>The System Capabilities Module comprises of two primary concepts: the system's capability to sense and the conditions
        under which it can do so. Both concepts are closely related and are often described as one and the same in industrial
        literature. The System Capabilities describes the properties of the measurement being performed by the system while the
        Operating Conditions describe the potentials environments in which the system is deployed. This separation is needed in order
        to account for the variability in the performance of the system under different environmental or operating parameters.
        Furthermore:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Some systems depend on unreported environmental measurements in order to produce results (e.g., temperature is a component of
            the relative humidity calculation)</li>
        <li>Some systems have requirements for proper operation for properties that they are unable to sense themselves
            (e.g., minimum power supply voltage)</li>
        <li>The performance of some systems may vary depending on the environmental context (e.g., the accuracy of a frequency counter
            may be affected by ambient temperature.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This information allows designers to communicate complex operating behavior to the consumer of the system results and to
        simplify procurement and system deployment decision by enabling searches for systems capable of fulfilling a specific
        requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reporting of operating conditions and capabilities is done through
        <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">observation collections</a> that aggregate <a href="#SOSAObservation">observations</a>.
        Each observation gives a value for a system or environment <a href="#SOSAProperty">property</a>.
        The information is typically provided by a system vendor, and in this context sensor, procedure, and timestamp
        are generally not reported.
    </p>
    <p>
        Reuse of <a>sosa:Observation</a> in this way ensures consistency in reporting values across the ontology,
        which is particularly helpful when the same observation can be used for reporting both a capability and
        operating condition.
        Note that this is application dependent, and nuances may prevent reuse: for example, a thermometer's
        capability is based on its ability to measure a medium while its survival conditions are based on its own
        physical temperature.

        <p>A system is linked to its operating conditions through property <a href="#SOSAhasOperatingConditions">hasOperatingConditions</a>.
            The operating conditions themselves are modelled as <a href="#SOSAObservation">observations</a> or <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">observation collections</a>, typically about the system environment.
            Furthermore, operating conditions can be typed by one of the sub-classes of <a href="#SOSAOperatingConditions">OperatingConditions</a> so as to explicit the desirability of the conditions. Three such sub-classes are provided as a basic classification:
            <a href="#SOSANormalOperatingConditions">NormalOperatingConditions</a>, <a href="#SOSASuboptimalOperatingConditions">SuboptimalOperatingConditions</a>,

        </p>
        <p>It is possible with additional ontological statements to create conditions that are &quot;latching&quot;, as in the case of
            damaged sensors with permanently degraded operating characteristics. It is also possible to describe operating modes of systems
            using all the expressivity of observations and observation collections. Implementers may define additional sub-classes of
            <a href="#SOSAOperatingConditions">OperatingConditions</a> to account for such use cases.

        <h5>System Capabilities</h5>
        <p>A system is linked to its capabilities through property <a href="#SOSAhasSystemCapability">hasSystemCapability</a>.
            The system capabilities themselves are modelled as <a href="#SOSAObservation">observations</a> or <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">observation
                collections</a>, that have for <a href="#SOSAobservedProperty">observed property</a> a property that qualifies some capability of the system.

        <p>Optionally, system capabilities may be linked through property <a href="#SOSAhasValidityContext">hasValidityContext</a> to some
            <a href="#SOSAObservation">observations</a> or <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">observation collections</a> that model the context under
            which the system capabilities are valid. These observations are typically about the system environment.
            Validity contexts are especially useful to describe performance bands of systems.
            Examples include environmental sensors that present different measurement accuracies in certain concentration ranges or that offer
            detection-only capabilities at very low concentrations.

        <p>
            System Capabilities are properties that are relevant while the system is in operation. Operating Conditions may be relevant irrespective of
            the operating state; a sensor that exceeds its <a href="#SOSASurvivableConditions">SurvivableConditions</a> will be rendered inoperable
            irrespective of whether it was powered on or off at the time, as in the case of a deep water sensor reaching its crush-depth.

        <h5>Property Validity Context</h5>

        <p>The object property <a href="#SOSAhasValidityContext">hasValidityContext</a> may be used to qualify the context in which a SOSA <a href="#SOSAProperty">Property</a> is valid. This context is modelled as individual <a href="#SOSAObservation">observations</a> or as grouped <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">observation collections</a>. When the qualified <a href="#SOSAProperty">Property</a> represents a system capability,
            the observed properties in the validity context typically refer to aspects of the system's operating environment.
            For example, water heaters are characterized by nominal power and efficiency values under specified inlet and outlet temperatures and flow rates, and their energy consumption at steady temperature is typically expressed in kWh/24h in the context where the water temperature is maintained at 65&nbsp;°C.

        <h4>Guidance on System Capability properties and ranges</h4>

        <p>The following example demonstrates a possible solution for describing sensor reading limitations using other ontologies such as I-ADOPT:</p>

        <pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/i-adopt.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <p>The advantage of this approach is that multiple statistical statements can be made about the property beyond that of simple
            maximum / minimum values, such as nominal or peak values.
        </p>
        <p>The Observation structure can similarly be used to report on the quality of individual results using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/">Data
                Quality Vocabulary</a>. In some applications, the properties of individual measurements vary within the operating conditions of the sensor.
            The values of these properties can then be reported alongside the individual result entries.
        </p>
        <pre class="example turtle" data-include="./rdf/examples/dqv.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

        <p>The System Capabilities Module also introduced a <a href="#SOSABattery">Battery</a> class to represent power supply requirements for mobile sensors.
            The illustrative <a href="#SOSACAPBatteryLifetime"><code>sosa-cap:BatteryLifetime</code></a> system capability property allows to record expected battery
            utilization either on a nominal basis or within different operating conditions.
