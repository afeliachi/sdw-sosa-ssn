<h3>DOLCE UltraLite Alignment Module</h3>
<p>This section introduces the alignment of SOSA to the DOLCE UltraLite upper ontology [[DUL]] which is the core
  dependency of the previous version of SSN. This serves to axiomatically clarify the intended meaning of SOSA terms
  and will assist SOSA users wishing to interoperate with other DUL-aligned ontologies.
  Note, however, that the DUL alignment can be used independently to align SOSA with more generic concepts/properties of DUL.
</p>
<p class="note">
  The SOSA-DUL alignment has been relaxed with respect to the previous edition, to account for the different usage of terms reported in <a href="#ModelPatterns"></a>.
  Only classes are aligned.

  <p>The upper-level classes from SOSA are aligned with the DUL classes as follows.
    The alignment of subclasses of these upper-level classes follows logically from these correspondences.

        <span title="Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.  More theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.). Here no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time. If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.  (1) Alternative aspectual views  Consider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one).  In the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).  The different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox?  A typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude. An alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity.  For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'. Consider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.  (2) Alternative intentionality views  Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces. Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event.  On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it.  Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.  (3) Alternative participant views  A slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them.  For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change. Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).  Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it.  Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas.  For this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer.">dul:Event</span>

It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame' (i.e. a Description).  For example, a PlanExecution is a context including some actions executed by agents according to certain parameters and expected tasks to be achieved from a Plan; a DiagnosedSituation is a context of observed entities that is interpreted on the basis of a Diagnosis, etc. Situation is also able to represent reified n-ary relations, where isSettingFor is the top-level relation for all binary projections of the n-ary relation. If used in a transformation pattern for n-ary relations, the designer should take care of creating only one subclass of Situation for each n-ary relation, otherwise the 'identification constraint' (Calvanese et al., IJCAI 2001) could be violated.">dul:Situation</span>

A design is usually accompanied by the rationales behind the construction of the designed Entity (i.e. of the reasons why a design is claimed to be as such). For example, the actual design (a Situation) of a car or of a law is based on both the specification (a Description) of the structure, and the rationales used to construct cars or laws. While designs typically describe entities to be constructed, they can also be used to describe 'refunctionalized' entities, or to hypothesize unknown functions. For example, a cradle can be refunctionalized as a flowerpot based on a certain home design.">dul:Design</span>

  <h4>Property Alignments</h4>
  <p>Due to the disjunctive (<span class="logic">or</span>) nature of several class alignments,
    SOSA object properties are not aligned to specific DUL properties.
    Instead, they can be understood to be uniformly aligned to the most general property,
    <span title="A general-purpose object property used to indicate an unspecified association between entities.">dul:associatedWith</span>,
    to ensure compatibility and enable flexible integration with DUL-aligned ontologies.

    The definition of <span title="A general-purpose object property used to indicate an unspecified association between entities.">dul:associatedWith</span> is displayed as a tooltip when hovering over the concept.
