<h3>Planning executions and collections</h3>
<p>
    Assets (Systems or Platforms) may be deployed with the intention of making Executions (Actuations, Observations, or
    Sampling) at some future time.
    Collections of Samples or Executions can be described ahead of their completion, inorder to indicate the intention
    to make collections with the given properties at a future date.
    Here we describe patterns that may be used in this way.

    <h4>Planned System Deployment</h4>
    <p>
        A specific <a>sosa:System</a> (<a>sosa:Actuator</a>, <a>sosa:Sensor</a>, <a>sosa:Sampler</a>) can be planned to
        be attached to a
        <a>sosa:Platform</a> as part of a <a>sosa:Deployment</a> during a nominated time interval.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, <a href="#Fig-PlannedDeployment"></a> describes the deployment of a specific <a>sosa:Sampler</a>
        (`ex:SA56`) on a specified <a>sosa:Platform</a> (`ex:LOIRE_A_JARGEAU_WQ_Station`) on the Loire River between
        2026 and 2028.
        This Sampler implements a nominated <a>sosa:SamplingProcedure</a>.
        It may be associated with a potential set of Samples, packaged in an empty <a>sosa:SampleCollection</a>
        (`ex:SC-LaJ1`).
    </p>
    <p>
        The resulting SampleCollection has no members prior to the deployment, but can be characterized prospectively in
        terms of
        the SamplingProcedure and Platform (station) used.

    <h4>Planned Collection using generic system</h4>
    <p>
        More generically, a Collection (i.e., <a>sosa:ActuationCollection</a>, <a>sosa:ObservationCollection</a>,
        <a>sosa:SamplingCollection</a>, or <a>sosa:SampleCollection</a>) can be described which is made by a potential
        deployment, where the actual system is only specified in terms of the Procedure implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, <a href="#Fig-PlannedSampleCollection"></a> describes a potential set of samples (`ex:SC-LaJ2`) of
        the Loire River, packaged in a <a>sosa:SampleCollection</a>, collected from a specified <a>sosa:Platform</a>,
        using a given <a>sosa:SamplingProcedure</a>.
        The actual <a>sosa:Sampler</a> is not specified, only that it must implement the nominated SamplingProcedure,
        and be deployed at the nominated station.
    </p>
    <figure id="Fig-PlannedSampleCollection">
        <embed alt="Planned sample collection" src="./images/PlannedSampleCollection.svg" style="width:90%" />
        <figcaption>
            A planned SampleCollection.
            `_:b1` is a "blank node" denoting some Sampler that implements `ex:sA56` and is deployed on
            `ex:LOIRE_A_JARGEAU_WQ_Station`.
            <br>
            <em><a href="#Class-diagram">Explanation of the notation used in class diagrams</a></em>.

    <pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/examples/PlannedSampleCollection.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

    <p>
        Then <a href="#Fig-PlannedObservationCollection"></a> describes a potential set of observations of <em>pH</em>
        (`ex:ObsColpH`),
        packaged in a <a>sosa:ObservationCollection</a>, whose (proximate) feature of interest is the set of Samples
        described above (`ex:SC-LaJ2`).
        Each member of the <a>sosa:ObservationCollection</a>must be consistent with the
        <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">requirements for membership of an ObservationCollection</a> - i.e., be
        sampled on the specified <a>sosa:Platform</a> using the nominated <a>sosa:ObservingProcedure</a> (`ex:pH-A56`),
        and whose <a>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</a> must be a member of the set of Samples (`ex:SC-LaJ2`).
        Again, the actual System (<a>sosa:Sensor</a>) is not specified, only that it must implement the nominated
        ObservingProcedure.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not specified that the observations are made at any particular time or place, so might be
        <em>ex-situ</em>.

            A planned ObservationCollection.
            `_:b3` is a "blank node" denoting a <a>sosa:Sensor</a> that is implied by the presence of the
