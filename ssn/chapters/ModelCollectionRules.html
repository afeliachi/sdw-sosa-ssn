<h3>Execution collections &mdash; consistency rules</h3>

<p>
    Properties of the members of <a href="#SOSAExecutionCollection">ExecutionCollections</a> must follow the consistency
    rules provided in their definitions.
    The following examples illustrate each case from the rules, in the context of an
    <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">ObservationCollection</a>.
    The patterns shown also apply to the other collection types.
</p>

<h4>Rule 1 &mdash; absent property on the collection</h4>

<p>
    Where an individual <a href="#SOSAExecutionCollection">ExecutionCollection</a>
    <i>omits a property</i>, a member <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a> (direct or transitive) MAY have any
    value for that property.
</p>

<p>
    Properties that are specified on the collection apply to every member, i.e., in this example
    <code>sosa:observedProperty</code>, <code>sosa:madeBySensor</code>, <code>qudt:hasUnit</code>.
    Properties that are not specified for the collection are provided individually on each member, i.e.,
    <code>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</code>, <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code>, <code>sosa:hasSimpleResult</code>.
</p>

<h4>Rule 2 &mdash; single property value on the collection</h4>

<p>
    Where an individual <a href="#SOSAExecutionCollection">ExecutionCollection</a> has
    <i>a single value for a property</i>, each member <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a> (direct or transitive)
    MUST have that same value for that property &mdash; i.e., the collection (set) is
    homogeneous in that property.
    That property MAY then be omitted in any member <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a> or
    <a href="#SOSAExecutionCollection">ExecutionCollection</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The collection has a single value for <code>sosa:observedProperty</code>, and any member with that property has the
    same value.
</p>

<h4>Rule 3 &mdash; multiple property values on the collection</h4>

<p>
    Where an individual <a href="#SOSAExecutionCollection">ExecutionCollection</a> has
    <i>more than one value for a property</i>, each member <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a>
    (direct or transitive) MUST have a value for that property that matches one of the values for the
    property in the collection.
</p>

<p>
    The collection has a multiple values for <code>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</code>, and each member has one of these
    values for that property.
</p>

<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/tests/ObservationCollection/OCrule3.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<h4>Rule 4 &mdash; range property value on the collection</h4>

<p>
    Where an individual <a href="#SOSAExecutionCollection">ExecutionCollection</a>
    <i>has a value for a property that is a range or interval</i>, each member
    <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a> (direct or transitive) MUST have a value for
    that property that matches or falls within that range or interval.
</p>

<p>
    The collection has a range of values for <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code>, and the value for that property on each
    member falls within the range.
</p>

<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/tests/ObservationCollection/OCrule4.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<h4>Rule 5 &mdash; multiple ranges property value on the collection</h4>

<p>
    Where an individual <a href="#SOSAExecutionCollection">ExecutionCollection</a>
    <i>has more than one value for a property that is a range or interval</i>, each member
    <a href="#SOSAExecution">Execution</a> (direct or transitive) MUST have a value for
    that property that matches or falls within one of those ranges or intervals.
</p>

<p>
    The collection has two ranges of values for <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code>, and the value for that property on
    each member falls within one of the ranges.
</p>
