<h3>Collections &mdash; consistency rules</h3>

<p>
    Properties of the members of <a href="#Collections">Collections</a> must follow the consistency
    rules given in their definitions &mdash; see <a href="#SOSAExecutionCollection">ExecutionCollection</a>,
    <a href="#SOSAActuationCollection">ActuationCollection</a>,
    <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">ObservationCollection</a>,
    <a href="#SOSASampleCollection">SampleCollection</a>, and <a href="#SOSASamplingCollection">SamplingCollection</a>.
    The following examples illustrate each case from the rules, in the context of an
    <a href="#SOSAObservationCollection">ObservationCollection</a>.
    The patterns shown also apply to the other collection types.
</p>

<h4>Rule 1 &mdash; absent property on the collection &mdash; optional</h4>

<blockquote>
    Where an individual Collection <i>omits a property</i>, a member (direct or transitive) MAY have any
    value for that property.
</blockquote>

<p>
    The properties <code>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</code>, <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code>,
    <code>sosa:hasSimpleResult</code> are not specified on the collection, but are provided individually on each member.
</p>

<h4>Rule 2 &mdash; single property value on the collection</h4>

<blockquote>
    Where an individual Collection has <i>a single value for a property</i>, each member (direct or
    transitive) MUST have that same value for that property i.e., the collection (set) is homogeneous in
    that property.
    That property MAY then be omitted in any member.
</blockquote>

<p>
    The properties <code>sosa:observedProperty</code>, <code>sosa:madeBySensor</code>, <code>qudt:hasUnit</code> are
    specified on the collection with single values, which apply to every member.
    Any member that also specifies <code>sosa:observedProperty</code> individually has this same value.
</p>

<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/tests/ObservationCollection/OCrule2.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<h4>Rule 3 &mdash; multiple property values on the collection</h4>

<blockquote>
    Where an individual Collection has <i>more than one value for a property</i>, each member (direct or
    transitive) MUST have a value for that property that matches one of the values for the property in the
    collection.
</blockquote>

<p>
    The collection specifies a multiple values for <code>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</code>.
    Each member has a value for <code>sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</code> taken from this set of values.
</p>

<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/tests/ObservationCollection/OCrule3.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<h4>Rule 4 &mdash; range property value on the collection</h4>

<blockquote>
    Where an individual Collection <i>has a value for a property that is a range or interval</i>, each
    member (direct or transitive) MUST have a value for that property that matches or falls within that
    range or interval.
</blockquote>

<p>
    The collection specifies a range of values for <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code>.
    Each member has a value for <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> that falls within the range.
</p>

<pre class="example" data-include="./rdf/tests/ObservationCollection/OCrule4.ttl" data-include-format="text"></pre>

<h4>Rule 5 &mdash; multiple ranges property value on the collection</h4>

<blockquote>
    Where an individual Collection <i>has more than one value for a property that is a range or
        interval</i>, each member (direct or transitive) MUST have a value for that property that matches or
    falls within one of those ranges or intervals.
</blockquote>

<p>
    The collection has two ranges of values for <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code>.
    Each member has a value for <code>sosa:phenomenonTime</code> that falls within one of the ranges.
