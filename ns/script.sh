# this script would populate the .ttl and .rdf files in the 2023 folder with the graphs that exist,
# and generate the redirections for the individual terms:

# with the idea that the first match found gets is executed, we'll implement:
# 302 to 2023 folder for terms that are part of 2023
# 302 to 2017 folder for terms that are part of 2017 (and are not matched yet)
